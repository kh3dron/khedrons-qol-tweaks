# khedron's QoL Tweaks

Custom factorio mod for QOL features I want.

## Inclusions

- roboports now transmit power inside their service areas: no more need for power poles if building in a roboport grid

## todo

- roboports also behave as a 4x4 grid of lamps
- all items craftable in inventory (engines)
- all buildings are lamps internally

## considered, but not included

- legendary buildings get more module slots? op
- bot speed increases? not needed
